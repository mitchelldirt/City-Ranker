# City-Ranker

This will be my first React project! :) 

After having run through the adding interactivity section of the new [React Docs](https://beta.reactjs.org/) I thought it woud be a good time for a project to make what I learned stick.

This will be a simple project where you can rank cities. First you search for and select a city (Google Geocoding) then you'll be provided an image for the city (Pexels API) and scores for walking 🚶‍♂️ , transit 🚊 , and biking 🚴  (walkscore API).

The inspiration for this project is derived from figuring out where I'd like to move in the future. walkability, bikability, and transit are all super important to me when choosing a place to live. I'm also just an opionated person who loves ranking things and learning about different places 🏙 😄
