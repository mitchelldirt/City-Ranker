# City-Ranker

This will be my first React project! :) 

After having run through the adding interactivity section of the new [React Docs](https://beta.reactjs.org/) I thought it woud be a good time for a project to make what I learned stick.

This will be a simple project where you can rank cities. First you search for and select a city (Google Geocoding) then you'll be provided an image for the city (Pexels API) and scores for walking 🚶‍♂️ , transit 🚊 , and biking 🚴  (walkscore API).

The inspiration for this project is simply that as an opionated person I love ranking things and I also love learning about different places 🏙 😄
